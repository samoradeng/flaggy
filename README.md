# Flagtriv - Real Multiplayer Setup Complete! 🎉

## 🚀 **Multiplayer Now Works Between Different Devices!**

The multiplayer system has been upgraded to use **Supabase** for real-time multiplayer functionality. Players can now challenge friends on different devices, anywhere in the world!

- ✅ **Cross-device multiplayer** - works between phones, tablets, computers
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - see other players join instantly
- ✅ **Global accessibility** - no WiFi network restrictions
- ✅ **Persistent games** - games survive browser refreshes

### **Without Supabase (Fallback):**
- ⚠️ **Single-device only** - localStorage fallback for testing
- ⚠️ **Same browser required** - different tabs can share games

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions:**
